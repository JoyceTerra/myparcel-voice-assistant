# MyParcel.com voice assistant 

## Introduction

  The purpose of this project is to use an Alexa Echo device as a voice assistant for label printing in order to simplify every day work for small webshop owners and warehouse employees. 

  By a simple voice command Alexa should retrieve all details neccessary for label printing from a list of today's orders and send it to a local printer, which then starts the printing process.
